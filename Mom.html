       <h2>Who is my mom?</h2>
       <p>My mom is from the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. She immigrated here 8 months after my dad, Henok. She first went to Chicago and Iowa. Then she went to Olney, where I was born. Then we settled just to the south of Olney, in Silver Spring, some 15 minutes away from there.</p>

        <h2>Sports and Recreation</h2>
        My mom likes sports, but doesn't have time to <strong>watch them.</strong> She especially liked Kobe Bryant, who died a few years ago. (RIP Kobe.)
        My mom's favorite singer is Ephrem Tamiru, an Ethiopian singer.
