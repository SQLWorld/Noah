    <h2>Music</h2>
    </p>
    <p>Music is a big part of road trips in my family. Sometimes we listen to 97.1, a radio devoted to just music. Or we ues good ol' Bluetooth to connect our phone to our car and listen to Ethiopian music. Some of my favorite songs are "Sir Duke", by Stevie Wonder, "Uptown Funk", by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars, "Akululu", by Michael Melaku and Asge Dendasho, and "Serkaddis", by Gossaye Tesfaye.</p>
